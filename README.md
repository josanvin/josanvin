# JOHAN

 My name is Johan. I have expertise as a Programmer (Senior Software Engineering) with more than 25 years of experience. I am a graduate of Bina Nusantara University with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems. I am capable of problem-solving errors and coding problems, working both individually and in teams.

For more than 5 years, I have been working as a Freelancer (Projects Developer) on various projects. I am a lifelong learner who is willing to learn new things anytime, quickly and skillfully.

My interest in IT started to grow since high school, and I have mastered all the basic techniques from OS Foxpro/Visual Basic to modern Web Server Programming.

In the future, I want to contribute to the world of technology with the skills, knowledge, and experience I have, hoping my contribution can be useful for many people.

If anyone is interested in learning and exploring programming, I will help as much as possible.

        if(found()){
            expand;
            new_method();
        } else {
            rest();
            coffee_first();
            continued();
        }

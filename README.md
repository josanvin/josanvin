# Irwan Antonio

My name is [Irwan Antonio](https://ir001.github.io) born in 2001. I am a Web Developer who loves to learn and read self-development books, and many other knowledge books. I have an interest in continuing to learn about developments in the world of technology which are increasingly developing.

Since junior high school my interest in the IT world has started to grow. I graduated from one of the favorite schools in the city of Purbalingga, namely SMK Negeri 1 Purbalingga. The reason I took the Software Engineering (RPL) major was to continue to develop my interest in IT.

And in the future I want to contribute to the world of technology with the skills, knowledge and experience I have. I hope that my contribution will be of use to many people.

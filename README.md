# JOHAN

My name is Johan. I have expertise in Programmer (Senior Software Engineering) with more than 15 years of experience. I am capable of problem solving errors and coding problems, working individually and in teams.

For more than 1 year working as a Freelancer (Projects Developer), I have worked on various projects. I am a lifelong learner who is willing to learn new things anytime quickly and skillfully.

Since high school, my interest in IT has started to grow, and have mastered all the basic techniques from OS (DOS 6.2), to Web Server Programming now.

And in the future I want to contribute to the world of technology with the skills, knowledge and experience I have. I hope my contribution can be useful for many people.

If anyone is interested in learning and exploring programming, I will help as much as possible.

## Motto

```php
<?php
    while(!succeed){
        try();
        learn();        
        if(found()){
            expand;
            new_method();
        } else {
            rest();
            coffee_first();
            continued();
        }        
    }
?>
